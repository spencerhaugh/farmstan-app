# FarmStan app

## Project 3: Software Engineering Immersive 9-21

This was our week 9 project, and it was a group project. We were tasked with building a full stack web app with a React front-end.

Our team was 4 people, 2 worked on the back-end, and 2 on the front-end. I was on the front-end team, working on building our our React components, CSS, and UI/UX.

The app was meant to be fully functional using CRUD, RESTful routes, MVC structure. However, the main lesson here was learning to work with a team in a collabrotive enivronment. Utilizing branches, avioding merge conflicts, careful pulling and pushing to Github, and submitting/approving merge requests.

This was a great "real world" project to put together in a short time.

## FarmStan

This app was to be a resource for consumers to find out what fruits & vegetables would be available at their local farmers market before leaving the house. Farms would create an account, and update weekly (or as needed) what veggies they had available, and what their current market schedule was (where to find them).

Users of the app could check out indivdual farms and their offerings, and also (and likely more realistically) check out which farms (and their product) would be avaiable at their local market.

# Current Status

This app is a work in progress, and is not at the place where it is ready for public consumption. The back-end models need to include veggie/fruit booleans for Farms to easily display available items.

The front-end looks like a modern app, and is responsive.

There is a lot more detail on the technologies used and specifics about the project in the API and Client repo README.md files, respectively.
